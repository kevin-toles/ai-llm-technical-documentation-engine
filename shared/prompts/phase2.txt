You are generating a scholarly cross-text annotation for Learning Python Ed.6.

CHAPTER {chapter_num}: {chapter_title}
KEY CONCEPTS: {concepts}

PRIMARY TEXT EXCERPT:
{excerpt}

YOUR PHASE 1 ANALYSIS:
- Validation: {validation_summary}
- Gaps Identified: {gap_analysis}
- Strategy: {analysis_strategy}

COMPANION BOOKS CONTENT (from {content_package_count} books):
{content_text}

TASK: Write a scholarly annotation that analyzes the relationship between the primary text and companion book excerpts.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:

1. VALIDATE EACH EXCERPT: For each companion book page above, determine:
   - Does it contain genuine technical/educational discussion of the matched concepts?
   - Or is it metadata, forewords, prefaces, or keyword-match artifacts?

2. FOR GENUINE TECHNICAL CONTENT:
   - Identify specific concepts that appear in BOTH the primary text and companion excerpt
   - Describe how the companion book treats these concepts differently (e.g., deeper implementation detail, alternative framing, architectural interpretation, formal description)
   - Cite concrete elements FROM THE COMPANION EXCERPT ITSELF (terminology, definitions, behaviors, code patterns, rules)
   - Explain the pedagogical reason a learner should consult this cross-reference (clarifies ambiguity, expands mechanics, formalizes definitions, offers advanced idioms)

3. FOR NON-SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT:
   - Acknowledge why the match occurred (token overlap or keyword similarity)
   - State explicitly that the page does NOT provide substantive technical treatment
   - Explain this is a limitation of keyword matching, not a conceptual relationship
   - Direct the learner to rely on the primary text for this topic

4. ORGANIZE BY TIER (when multiple genuine sources exist):
   - Architecture Spine books: Patterns, DDD, theoretical frameworks
   - Implementation Layer books: Practical applications, deployment, real-world usage
   - Engineering Practices books: Language idioms, protocols, advanced techniques
   - Show connections across tiers when applicable

STRICT RULES:
- BE SPECIFIC. Use actual phrasing or technical elements from the excerpts
- DO NOT invent connections. Only describe relationships grounded in provided excerpts
- DO NOT use generic filler: "complements," "broadens," "enhances," "deepens"
- DO NOT summarize the books—analyze their relationship to the primary text
- DO NOT exceed 10 sentences total (aim for 5-7)
- OUTPUT ONLY the annotation text, no metadata or JSON
