    "response_text": "The chapter's introduction to Python's core object types\u2014strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets\u2014establishes foundational data structures, yet the companion corpus retrieved for this annotation contains no substantive excerpts addressing these concepts from either the Architecture Spine or Implementation tiers. This represents a significant gap, as texts like *Fluent Python, 2nd Edition* (Ramalho) would typically provide deep treatment of Python's data model, including the distinction between mutable and immutable sequences, dictionary implementation via hash tables, and the special methods underlying these built-in types. Similarly, *Learning Python, 6th Edition* (Lutz) would offer extended coverage of type hierarchies and dynamic typing mechanics that contextualize why Python treats \"everything as an object.\" Without retrieved excerpts from these Implementation-tier sources, learners should consult the primary text directly for its treatment of polymorphism across built-in types and the shared operation sets (indexing, slicing, iteration) that unify sequence types. For architectural grounding on how these primitive types inform larger system design\u2014particularly dictionary-based dispatch patterns and tuple-based immutable records\u2014*Architecture Patterns with Python* (Percival & Gregory) would typically provide relevant context, but no such content was retrieved. Learners seeking to connect this chapter's type taxonomy to production concerns should independently consult the Implementation-tier references in this corpus for formal treatment of Python's object protocol and memory model.",
