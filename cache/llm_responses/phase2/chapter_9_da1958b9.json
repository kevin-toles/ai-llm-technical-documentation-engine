    "response_text": "The chapter's treatment of Python tuples, files, and core data structures cannot be meaningfully cross-referenced with companion texts, as no substantive excerpts from the corpus were retrieved for this content. This represents a significant gap in the available cross-reference material: while *Learning Python, 6th Edition* (Lutz) would typically provide foundational coverage of tuple immutability, unpacking semantics, and file I/O protocols, and *Fluent Python, 2nd Edition* (Ramalho) would offer advanced treatment of named tuples and the iterator protocol underlying file objects, no specific passages from these Implementation tier texts were matched to this chapter. Similarly, Architecture Spine texts such as *Architecture Patterns with Python* might contextualize how immutable data structures support domain modeling, but no such connections are available from the retrieved content. Learners should consult the primary text directly for this material, recognizing that Python's fundamental data types and file handling mechanisms\u2014while essential to all application development including AI systems\u2014require dedicated language reference sources not surfaced in this cross-reference query.",
