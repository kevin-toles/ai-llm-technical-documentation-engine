    "response_text": "I cannot generate a substantive cross-reference annotation for this chapter because no companion book excerpts were retrieved from the corpus. The analysis strategy outlined above describes how I would synthesize connections across Architecture Spine texts (for domain event patterns and bounded context communication), Implementation Layer sources (for async framework integration and message broker implementations), and Engineering Practices references (for testing event-driven systems)\u2014but none of these materials are present in the provided data.\n\nWithout actual companion content, any annotation would violate the strict requirement to ground all claims in provided excerpts. The chapter's treatment of event-driven architecture, including its coverage of Redis pub/sub, message bus patterns, and temporal decoupling through events, stands alone in this corpus. Learners seeking complementary perspectives on these topics should consult specialized texts on domain-driven design (for aggregate boundaries and domain events), distributed systems architecture (for message broker patterns and eventual consistency), and Python async programming (for concurrent event processing implementations)\u2014none of which are available here for citation.",
