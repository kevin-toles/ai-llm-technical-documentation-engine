    "response_text": "The chapter on module packages within this primary text addresses Python's organizational mechanisms for structuring larger codebases, yet the companion corpus provides no retrieved excerpts for cross-reference analysis. This represents a significant gap in the Architecture Spine tier, where texts such as *Architecture Patterns with Python* would typically illuminate how package structure supports domain-driven design boundaries and the separation of concerns at the module level. Similarly, the Implementation tier lacks the expected coverage from *Fluent Python, 2nd Edition* or *Learning Python, 6th Edition*, which would normally detail the mechanics of `__init__.py` files, relative versus absolute imports, and namespace packages introduced in Python 3.3. Without substantive companion content, learners must rely entirely on the primary text for understanding how module packages enable code organization, dependency management, and the creation of distributable libraries. For comprehensive treatment of Python packaging conventions, including `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and the distinction between regular and namespace packages, readers should consult the Python Packaging Authority documentation or dedicated implementation texts not present in this retrieval set.",
