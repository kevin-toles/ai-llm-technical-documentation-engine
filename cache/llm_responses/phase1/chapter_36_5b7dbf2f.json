The chapter summary indicates this is an Architecture-tier topic covering exception design patterns, custom exception hierarchies, and their application in web services and data pipelines. Without access to companion book metadata, I cannot identify specific chapters to request. If companion books were available, I would prioritize: (1) Architecture Spine books for design patterns related to error handling and resilience patterns; (2) Implementation Layer books like FastAPI/Flask for practical API error handling implementations; (3) Engineering Practices books for Python-specific exception idioms and best practices. The annotation would synthesize how exception design principles manifest across architectural theory, practical implementation, and Pythonic conventions. I acknowledge this gap and recommend re-running with populated companion book metadata to enable meaningful cross-references.\"\n}\n```",
