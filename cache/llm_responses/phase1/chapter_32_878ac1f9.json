The chapter summary references internal connections to Chapters 26, 29, and 39 within Learning Python itself, plus external frameworks (Django, SQLAlchemy). Without access to companion book metadata, I cannot make specific content requests. If companion books were available, I would prioritize: (1) Architecture books covering design patterns, dependency injection, and plugin architectures that leverage ABCs; (2) Implementation books showing FastAPI/Flask dependency systems or SQLAlchemy's declarative patterns that use metaclasses; (3) Python reference materials on the descriptor protocol, MRO algorithm, and abc module internals. The annotation would synthesize how advanced class topics enable the architectural patterns used in production frameworks.\"\n}\n```",
