The chapter metadata section shows '0 books with chapter metadata', meaning there are no companion sources to cross-reference against. Without access to any companion book metadata or content, I cannot make specific chapter requests or build cross-references. The source chapter discusses class design principles that would naturally connect to: (1) Architecture-tier books covering design patterns, SOLID principles, and domain-driven design; (2) Implementation-tier books showing practical class usage in frameworks like FastAPI or Flask; (3) Engineering practices books covering Python idioms and advanced class features. However, since no companion books are loaded in this package, I must acknowledge this gap rather than fabricate connections. If companion book metadata becomes available, I would prioritize requesting chapters on: design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Template Method), dependency injection, composition vs inheritance, abstract base classes, and framework-specific class architectures.\"\n}\n```",
