However, **the companion books section explicitly states \"0 books with chapter metadata\"** and contains no book entries.\n\nWithout companion book metadata, I cannot:\n1. Identify which books exist in the corpus\n2. Request specific chapters for cross-referencing\n3. Build the tier-based scholarly annotation\n\n**Per the guardrails**: I am acknowledging this gap rather than forcing connections that cannot be substantiated. If companion book metadata becomes available, I can re-analyze this chapter to build genuine cross-references across the Architecture Spine, Implementation Layer, and Engineering Practices tiers.",
