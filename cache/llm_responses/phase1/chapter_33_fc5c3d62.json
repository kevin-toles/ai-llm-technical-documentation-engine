The chapter metadata section shows '0 books with chapter metadata', meaning there is no corpus of companion materials to analyze against this source chapter on Exception Basics. Without access to companion book metadata or content, I cannot identify specific chapters to request or build meaningful cross-references. The annotation will need to acknowledge this gap and focus on the internal forward references already noted in the source chapter (Chapters 34, 35, Part VI on OOP, and Chapter 9 on files). If companion book metadata becomes available in a future iteration, I would prioritize: (1) Python idiom/practices books for EAFP patterns and Pythonic exception handling conventions, (2) Architecture books for error handling as a cross-cutting concern and resilience patterns, and (3) Implementation books (FastAPI, Flask) for practical exception handling in web applications and API error responses.\"\n}\n```",
