The chapter covers dependency injection and bootstrapping patterns in Python, with specific focus on:\\n\\n1. **Core DI Concepts**: The chapter demonstrates how to wire dependencies explicitly rather than hiding them, using a bootstrap function to initialize the application with appropriate implementations (real database vs in-memory for testing).\\n\\n2. **Testing Patterns**: Heavy emphasis on pytest fixtures, fake implementations, and edge-to-edge testing strategies that leverage dependency injection for test isolation.\\n\\n3. **Framework Integration**: Shows practical examples of integrating DI patterns with Flask and Django, including custom Unit of Work implementations that respect framework transaction management.\\n\\n4. **Context Manager Protocol**: Demonstrates __enter__ and __exit__ methods for resource management, particularly in the context of database transactions and ORM session handling.\\n\\n5. **Architecture Wiring**: Connects the dependency injection pattern to broader hexagonal/clean architecture concepts, showing how to wire ports (abstractions) to adapters (implementations) at application startup.\\n\\n**Ideal Cross-Reference Strategy (if books were available)**:\\n- **Tier 1 (Architecture)**: Would reference DDD aggregates, bounded contexts, and how DI supports domain isolation; microservices patterns for service initialization\\n- **Tier 2 (Implementation)**: Would connect to FastAPI dependency injection system, Flask application factories, practical Python patterns for composition\\n- **Tier 3 (Engineering)**: Would reference Python decorators (alternative to DI), context managers in depth, class design patterns, testing best practices\\n\\nWithout companion books, I can only provide a standalone annotation based on the chapter content itself, focusing on the pedagogical progression from simple bootstrap functions to framework-integrated dependency management.\"\n}\n```",
