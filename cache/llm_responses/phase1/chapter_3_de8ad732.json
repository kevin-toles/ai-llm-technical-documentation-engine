I'll map the execution model concepts to both theoretical foundations (how Python processes code) and practical applications (deployment pipelines, production systems). The annotation and data processing concepts that appear in the excerpts will be connected to modern AI/ML engineering practices where relevant, though the primary focus remains on Python execution fundamentals as the chapter's core pedagogical objective.\"\n}\n```",
