#### **Abstraction** *(p.41)*

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Architecture Patterns, p.41, lines 2–9)*:
```
[ 22 ]
Leaking abstractions
When an abstraction is leaking details from the implementation, and not presenting a 
perfectly opaque image, it's called a leaky abstraction.
While a good API should try to avoid this, sometimes it happens. This can be caused 
by underlying bugs in the code serving the API, or sometimes directly from the way 
the code operates in certain operations.
A common case for this is relational databases. SQL abstracts the process of

Security aspects of software architecture
An important element to take into consideration when creating an architecture is 
the security requirements. Not every application is the same, so some can be more 
relaxed in this aspect than others. For example, a banking application needs to be 100 
times more secure than, say, an internet forum for discussing cats. The most common 
example of this is the storage of passwords. The most naive approach to passwords 
is to store them, in plain text, associated with a username or email address – say, in a

The SameSite attribute greatly reduces the risk of CSRF, but in case the attribute 
is not understood by older browsers, operations presented to the user by the bank 
should present a random token, making the user send both the authenticated request 
with the cookie and a valid token. An external page won't know a valid random 
token, making this exploit much more difficult.

electronic computers were invented to break encryption codes. As the possibilities 
of the new invention started to be explored, more and more complex operations and 
systems were designed. Tools like compilers and high-level languages multiplied the 
number of possibilities and the rapid advancement of hardware allowed more and 
more operations to be performed. This quickly created a need to manage the growing 
complexity and apply consistent engineering principles to the creation of software.

#### **Close** *(p.27)*

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Architecture Patterns, p.27, lines 14–21)*:
```
The main thing for the successful application of any software architecture is that 
the team structure needs to follow the designed architecture quite closely. Trying 
to deviate too much will result in difficulties, as the tendency will be to structure, 
de facto, everything following group divisions. In the same way, changing the 
architecture of a system would likely necessitate restructuring the organization. 
This is a difficult and painful process, as anyone who has experienced a company 
reorganization will attest.
Division of responsibilities is also a key aspect. A single software element should

descriptor can help the handling of unexpected cases and simplify debugging issues.
For example, the mentioned PATCH may return this body:
{
    "message": "Field 'address' is unknown"
}
This will give specific details about the problem. Other options include returning 
error codes, multiple messages in case there are multiple possible errors, and also

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Architecture Patterns, p.26, lines 8–15)*:

The important characteristic is that in order to create an independent element, the 
API needs to be clearly defined and the responsibility needs to be well defined. It 
should be possible for the module to be extracted into a different repo and installed 
as a third-party element for it to be considered truly independent.
Inside the same component, communication is typically straightforward, as internal 
APIs will be used. In the vast majority of cases, the same programming language will 
be used.

Leaky abstractions are, to a certain degree, unavoidable. They are the result of not 
living in a perfect world. Software is fallible. Understanding and preparing for that is 
critical.

While we are mainly talking about APIs, and throughout the book

Performance improvements in hardware and software and external tools to handle

some organizations. To a certain degree, the architect role overtakes parts of this role, 
though with more of a supervising role and less of a gatekeeping one.
There are multiple DBMSes available on the market, with a good selection of open 
source software that covers most use cases. Roughly speaking, we can divide the 
existing DBMS alternatives into this non-exhaustive classification:

operations, any problem, like a constraint issue, is detected.
ACID transactions have a cost in terms of performance, and especially in terms 
of scalability. The need for durability means that data needs to be stored on disk 
or other permanent support before being returned from the transaction. The

The main advantage of this approach is detaching the application from the user 
interface. Where an application starts its development as a small project with a 
regular HTML interface, the risk is that any other user interface will tend to conform 
to the HTML interface. This can quickly add up to a lot of technical debt and

business flows.
For a lot of different concepts, the Model works purely as a replication of the

An alternative to sharding by shard key, for smaller clusters, is to separate tables or 
collections by server. This means that any query in table X is directed to a specific 
server, and the rest of the queries are directed to another. This strategy only works 
for unrelated tables, as it's not possible to perform joins between tables in different 
servers.
Downscale operations are more complicated than upscale, as the

```
In this chapter, we described what the principles behind Domain-Driven Design 
are, to orient the abstraction of storing data and use rich objects that follow business 
principles. We also described ORM frameworks and how they can be useful to 
remove the need to deal with low-level interaction with specific libraries to work 
with the storage layer. We described different useful techniques for the code to 
interact with the database, like the Unit of Work pattern, which is related to the 
concept of a transaction, and CQRS for advanced cases where the write and read are 
addressed to different backends.

We will also cover event-driven systems, taking two chapters to be sure to cover the 
basic and more advanced uses. Event-driven systems are asynchronous by nature, 
meaning that the calling system won't wait until the processing is done, and in a lot 
of cases, there won't even be something similar to a response. These systems are very 
useful for dealing either with triggering multiple services with the same input or for 
generating results that take a long time to process. 
We'll also discuss monolithic systems compared with microservices, and the different 
tools and techniques to use in both cases, including migrating from one to the other.

For example, for Django, the following general procedure can be used:

present, or to change the scale of a measurement from inches to centimeters.
In either case, these actions may need to be performed for all rows or only for a

speed up the process, especially for big databases.

Instead, long task workers should return the job to the queue and cancel the 
execution. This way, the task will be performed again, and to ensure that this doesn't 
duplicate actions, we need to ensure that all tasks can be canceled by waiting until 
the end of it to save its results and wrapping them into a transaction or similar.

*Source: Python Architecture Patterns: Master API Design, Event-driven Structures, and Package Management in Python, pages 219–254*

### Chapter Summary
Examines aggregates as consistency boundaries in domain-driven design. Discusses aggregate roots, enforcing invariants, transactional boundaries, and designing for consistency vs eventual consistency in distributed systems. [^115]

### Concept-by-Concept Breakdown
#### **Args** *(p.230)*

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Architecture Patterns, p.230, lines 4–11)*:
```
    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        user = Usr.objects.get(username=self.kwargs['username'])
        serializer.save(user=user)
We will check the serializer later. The class requires defining the queryset that it will 
use to retrieve the information when the LIST part of the class is called. Because our 
URL includes the username, we need to identify it:
    def get_queryset(self):
        result = Micropost.objects.filter(

The number of priority workers can be tweaked based on the number and frequency 
of spikes and expected turnaround time. Only enough priority workers to cover 
regular traffic at the times where there are big spikes in background tasks are 
required, as long as those spikes are predictable.
An alternative is to generate a priority system based on specific priorities, like 
numbers. That way, a task with priority 3 will be executed before a task with priority 
2, and that before a task with priority 1, and so on. The great advantage of having

#### **Async** *(p.238)*

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Architecture Patterns, p.238, lines 11–18)*:
```
In this chapter, we will introduce the concept, and we will describe in detail one 
of the most popular uses of it: creating asynchronous tasks that are executed in the 
background while the caller of the task continues uninterrupted.
In the chapter, we will describe the basics of asynchronous tasks, including the 
details of queueing systems and how to generate automatically scheduled tasks.
We will use Celery as an example of a popular task manager in Python that has 
multiple capabilities. We will show specific examples of how to perform common 
tasks. We will also explore Celery Flower, a tool that creates a web interface to

independently and without breaking backward compatibility. 
Any change in the schema will require extra care to ensure that the 
system can perform at any point, without interruption. Exposing 
an API and keeping the database under the full control of the 
front-end service is a good solution, but keep in mind that requests 
originating from the back-end will compete with external requests, 
so we need enough capacity for both.

data and waiting until the other part returns a response, it just sends data and 
continues executing.
This makes it different from the request-response architecture that we saw in the 
previous chapter. A request-response process will wait until an appropriate response 
is generated. Meanwhile, the execution of more code will stop, as the new data 
produced by the external system is required to continue.
In an event-driven system, there's no response data, at least not in the same sense. 
Instead, an event containing the request will be sent, and the task will just continue.

Model stores a string of text and the user that created the micropost. Optionally, it 
can store a referenced user.
A serializer can't only transform a Model object, but any kind of 
internal Python class. You can use them to create "virtual objects" 
that can pull information from multiple Models.

They'll be all reported in order, with the latest value being 
returned. If you need to access all values, use the method getlist:

increase throughput by taking advantage of having multiple subscribers that can 
execute these smaller tasks. We described how tasks can be added automatically at

Following the Agile principles, we know that working software is more 
important than extensive documentation. However, in microservices, it's 
important to maximize the usability of each individual microservice to 
reduce the amount of support between teams. That involves some degree of 
documentation. The best approach is to create self-documenting services.

We will continue talking about more features of pytest during the chapter, but first, 
we need to go back to how to define tests when the code has dependencies.
Testing external dependencies
When building unit tests, we talked about how it's based around the concept of 
isolating a unit in the code to test it independently.
This isolation concept is key, as we want to focus on small sections of the code to 
create small, clear tests. Creating small tests also helps in keeping the tests fast.

docker-compose is part of the general offering by Docker. It works very well for small 
deployments or local development. It defines a single YAML file that contains the 
definition of the different services, and the name that they can use. It can be used 
to replace a lot of docker build and docker run commands, as it can define all the 
parameters in the YAML file.
Kubernetes is aimed at bigger deployments and clusters and allows the generation 
of a full logical structure for containers to define how they connect to one another, 
thereby allowing abstraction to the underlying infrastructure.

No monkey-patching mock is required. Monkey-patching can be quite 
fragile, as it's meddling with internal code that's not supposed to be exposed. 
While in testing this interference is not the same as doing it for regular code 
running, it's still something that can be messy and have unintended effects, 
especially if the internal code changes in some unforeseen way.

In a system serving requests, either as request-response or asynchronously, most 
of the logs will be generated as part of dealing with a request, which will produce 
several logs indicating what the request is doing. Because more than one request will 
normally be undergoing processing at once, the logs will be generated intermixed. 
For example, consider the following logs:
Sept 16 20:42:04.130 10.1.0.34 INFO web: REQUEST GET /login
Sept 16 20:42:04.170 10.1.0.37 INFO api: REQUEST GET /api/login

But expected errors are not the only ones that can occur. Unfortunately, any running 
system will surprise you with all kinds of unexpected behavior that will break the 
code in creative ways. Unexpected errors in Python are normally produced by 
an exception being raised at some point in the code when that exception won't be 
captured.
For example, imagine that when making a small change to some code, we introduce 
a typo:

Analysis: To detect problems in more controlled situations, we have two 
important tools, debugging and profiling. The first is a staple of the 
development process, working step by step through code to understand how 
a piece of code works and ascertain why it's doing what it is doing. Profiling 
is instrumenting the code to show how it works and, specifically, determine 
which parts take the most time to execute, to allow you to act on them and 
improve their performance. 
These two tools work complementarily with one another and allow us to fix

```
Profiling is a dynamic analysis that instruments code to understand how it runs. 
This information is extracted and compiled in a way that can be used to get a better 
knowledge of a particular behavior based on a real case, as the code is running as 
usual. This information can be used to improve the code.
The normal application of profiling is to improve the performance of the code under 
analysis. By understanding how it executes in practice, it sheds light on the dynamics 
of the code modules and parts that could be causing problems. Then, actions can be 
taken in those specific areas.

Then, we create a range of numbers that starts from 3 (we already tested 2) and 
continue until the square root of the number. We use the math module to perform 
the action and to floor the number to the nearest lower integer. The range function 
requires a +1 of this number, as it doesn't include the defined number. Finally, the 
range step on 2 integers at  time so that all the numbers are odd, since we started 
with 3.

Debugging
Generally speaking, the cycle for debugging problems has the following steps:
1.	 Detecting the problem. A new problem or defect is discovered
2.	 Analyzing and assigning priority to this problem, to be sure that we spend 
time on meaningful problems and focus on the most important ones
3.	 Investigating what exactly causes the problem. Ideally, this should end with 
a way of replicating the problem in a local environment

The first step is actually detecting the problem. This can sound a bit silly, but it's a

Detecting problems can be done in different ways, and some may be more evident 
than others. Normally, once the code is in production, defects will be detected by a 
user, either internally (best case) or externally (worst case), or through monitoring.

To provide certain features or characteristics previously not available – for 
example, adding an event-driven system to run asynchronous tasks, allowing 
us to avoid the request-response pattern that was previously all that was 
available.

Because there are bottlenecks or limitations with the current architecture. For 
example, only a single database is present in the system and there's a limit on 
the number of queries that can run.

The most useful function for introspection, though, is dir. dir allows you to see all 
the methods and attributes in an object, and it's particularly useful when analyzing 
objects from a not-clear origin, or where the interface is not clear.

Using these tools is good, but let's see how we can understand the behavior of the 
code.
Debugging with logs
A simple yet effective way of detecting what's going on and how the code is being 
executed is adding comments that are displayed either containing statements like 
starting the loop here or including values of variables like Value of A = X. By
