first-class data analysis language.
John was very close with Fernando Pérez and Brian Granger, pioneers of IPython,
Jupyter, and many other initiatives in the Python community. We had hoped to work
on a book together, the four of us, but I ended up being the one with the most free
time. I am sure he would be proud of what we’ve accomplished, as individuals and as
a community, over the last nine years.

in 2022, there are fewer Python language changes (we are now at Python 3.10, with
3.11 coming out at the end of 2022), but pandas has continued to evolve.
In this third edition, my goal is to bring the content up to date with current versions
of Python, NumPy, pandas, and other projects, while also remaining relatively con‐
servative about discussing newer Python projects that have appeared in the last few
years. Since this book has become an important resource for many university courses
and working professionals, I will try to avoid topics that are at risk of falling out of
date within a year or two. That way paper copies won’t be too difficult to follow in

applications, particularly applications with many CPU-bound threads. The reason for
this is that it has what is known as the global interpreter lock (GIL), a mechanism that
prevents the interpreter from executing more than one Python instruction at a time.
The technical reasons for why the GIL exists are beyond the scope of this book. While
it is true that in many big data processing applications, a cluster of computers may be
required to process a dataset in a reasonable amount of time, there are still situations
where a single-process, multithreaded system is desirable.
This is not to say that Python cannot execute truly multithreaded, parallel code.

pandas blends the array-computing ideas of NumPy with the kinds of data manipu‐

Attributes and methods
Objects in Python typically have both attributes (other Python objects stored

The built-in collections module has a useful class, defaultdict, which makes this
even easier. To create one, you pass a type or function for generating the default value
for each slot in the dictionary:
In [115]: from collections import defaultdict
In [116]: by_letter = defaultdict(list)
In [117]: for word in words:
   .....:     by_letter[word[0]].append(word)

A dictionary comprehension looks like this:

A set comprehension looks like the equivalent list comprehension except with curly
braces instead of square brackets:
set_comp = {expr for value in collection if condition}
Like list comprehensions, set and dictionary comprehensions are mostly convenien‐
ces, but they similarly can make code both easier to write and read. Consider the

Thus, the dictionary methods get and pop can take a default value to be returned, so
that the above if-else block can be written simply as:
value = some_dict.get(key, default_value)
get by default will return None if the key is not present, while pop will raise an
exception. With setting values, it may be that the values in a dictionary are another
kind of collection, like a list. For example, you could imagine categorizing a list of
words by their first letters as a dictionary of lists:

```
There is no issue with having multiple return statements. If Python reaches the end
of a function without encountering a return statement, None is returned automati‐
cally. For example:
In [177]: def function_without_return(x):

hello!

The encoding used to interpret bytes in the file as Unicode (typically UTF-8)
Bytes and Unicode with Files
The default behavior for Python files (whether readable or writable) is text mode,
which means that you intend to work with Python strings (i.e., Unicode). This
contrasts with binary mode, which you can obtain by appending b to the file mode.
Revisiting the file (which contains non-ASCII characters with UTF-8 encoding) from
the previous section, we have:

one reason Python is so popular for text and file munging.

numerical computing tools like NumPy and SciPy, analytical libraries like statsmo‐

Line Plots
Series and DataFrame have a plot attribute for making some basic plot types. By
default, plot() makes line plots (see Figure 9-13):

 100, 10))

The axes class has a set method that allows batch setting of plot properties. From the
prior example, we could also have written:

Adding legends
Legends are another critical element for identifying plot elements. There are a couple
of ways to add one. The easiest is to pass the label argument when adding each piece
of the plot:

pandas also supports indexes based on timedeltas, which can be a
useful way of representing experiment or elapsed time. We do not
explore timedelta indexes in this book, but you can learn more in
the pandas documentation.
pandas provides many built-in time series tools and algorithms. You can efficiently
work with large time series, and slice and dice, aggregate, and resample irregular-
and fixed-frequency time series. Some of these tools are useful for financial and
economics applications, but you could certainly use them to analyze server log data,

offset
An offset timedelta added to the origin; defaults to None
Downsampling
Downsampling is aggregating data to a regular, lower frequency. The data you’re
aggregating doesn’t need to be fixed frequently; the desired frequency defines bin
edges that are used to slice the time series into pieces to aggregate. For example,
to convert to monthly, "M" or "BM", you need to chop up the data into one-month
intervals. Each interval is said to be half-open; a data point can belong only to one

disproportionate amount of time with data wrangling and preparation, the book’s
structure reflects the importance of mastering these techniques.
Which library you use for developing models will depend on the application. Many
statistical problems can be solved by simpler techniques like ordinary least squares
regression, while other problems may call for more advanced machine learning
methods. Fortunately, Python has become one of the languages of choice for imple‐
menting analytical methods, so there are many tools you can explore after completing
this book.

11.7 Moving Window Functions
An important class of array transformations used for time series operations are
statistics and other functions evaluated over a sliding window or with exponentially
decaying weights. This can be useful for smoothing noisy or gappy data. I call these
moving window functions, even though they include functions without a fixed-length
window like exponentially weighted moving average. Like other statistical functions,
these also automatically exclude missing data.
Before digging in, we can load up some time series data and resample it to business

Resampling refers to the process of converting a time series from one frequency
to another. Aggregating higher frequency data to lower frequency is called downsam‐
pling, while converting lower frequency to higher frequency is called upsampling.
Not all resampling falls into either of these categories; for example, converting W-WED
(weekly on Wednesday) to W-FRI is neither upsampling nor downsampling.

The material extends the foundational understanding established in this chapter by exploring more advanced applications, deeper implementation details, or integration with other Python features. Readers seeking to deepen their mastery of these topics should plan to revisit this chapter after completing the current material.
[^225]

**Annotation:** Forward reference: Chapter 13 shares 5 concept(s) with this chapter, indicating topical continuity and progressive skill development. The concepts None, argument appear in both contexts, suggesting that understanding from this chapter will directly transfer to and be expanded upon in the later material.

Indirect Sorts: argsort and lexsort
In data analysis you may need to reorder datasets by one or more keys. For example,
a table of data about some students might need to be sorted by last name, then by first
name. This is an example of an indirect sort, and if you’ve read the pandas-related
chapters, you have already seen many higher-level examples. Given a key or keys (an
array of values or multiple arrays of values), you wish to obtain an array of integer
indices (I refer to them colloquially as indexers) that tells you how to reorder the data
