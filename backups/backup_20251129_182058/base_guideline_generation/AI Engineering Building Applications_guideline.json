Many of the topics\ndiscussed in Chapter 8 are relevant beyond finetuning, including the\nquestion of what data quality means and how to evaluate the quality of your\ndata.\nIf Chapters 5 to 8 are about improving a model’s quality, Chapter 9 is about\nmaking its inference cheaper and faster. It discusses optimization both at the\nmodel level and inference service level.

So,\n100 tokens are approximately 75 words.\nThe set of all tokens a model can work with is the model’s vocabulary. You\ncan use a small number of tokens to construct a large number of distinct\nwords, similar to how you can use a few letters in the alphabet to construct\nmany words.

I mention feature-based transfer briefly in Chapter 2, when\ndiscussing how part of a foundation model can be reused for a classification task by adding a\nclassifier head.\nFeature-based transfer is very common in computer vision. For instance, in the second half of the\n2010s, many people used models trained on the ImagetNet dataset to extract features from images\nand use these features in other computer vision tasks such as object detection or image segmentation.\nFinetuning is part of a model’s training process.
