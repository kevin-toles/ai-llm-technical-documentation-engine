cache memory)\nbetween the processor and a larger, slower device (e.g., main memory) turns out\norganized as a memory hierarchy similar to Figure 1.9.\nWe show three levels of caching L1 to L3, occupying memory\nMain memory occupies level 4, and so on.\nThe main idea of a memory hierarchy is that storage at one level serves as a\nis a cache for the main memory, which is a cache for the

and how we will order the bytes in memory.\nIn virtually all machines, a multi-byte object is stored as a contiguous sequence\nFor example, suppose a variable x of type int has address 0x100; that is, the\nThen (assuming data type int has a\n32-bit representation) the 4 bytes of x would be stored in memory locations 0x100,\nFor ordering the bytes representing an object, there are two common

0x100\nthrough 0x103 depends on the type of machine:\nNote that in the word 0x01234567 the high-order byte has hexadecimal value\n0x01, while the low-order byte has value 0x67.\nIn practice, however,

expressions that are computed as the array is being allocated.\nIn the C version of variable-size arrays, we can declare an array\naccess element i, j of an n \u00d7 n array as follows:\nint var_ele(long n, int A[n][n], long i, long j) {\nGcc generates code for this referencing function as\nint var_ele(long n, int A[n][n], long i, long j)\nn in %rdi, A in %rsi, i in %rdx, j in %rcx\nAs the annotations show, this code computes the address of element i, j as xA +\nWhen variable-size arrays are referenced within a loop, the compiler can often\nFor example, Figure 3.38(a) shows C code to compute element i, k of the product\nof two n \u00d7 n arrays A and B.\nThis code follows a different style from the optimized\ncode for the \ufb01xed-size array (Figure 3.37), but that is more an artifact of the choices\nThe code of Figure 3.38(b) retains loop variable j, both to detect when\n(a) Original C code\nint var_prod_ele(long n, int A[n][n], int B[n][n], long i, long k) {\n(b) Optimized C code\nint var_prod_ele_opt(long n, int A[n][n], int B[n][n], long i, long k) {\nOriginal and optimized code to compute element i, k of matrix product for variable-size\narrays.\nThe following is the assembly code for the loop of var_prod_ele:\nRegisters: n in %rdi, Arow in %rsi, Bptr in %rcx\n4n in %r9, result in %eax, j in %edx\nWe see that the program makes use of both a scaled value 4n (register %r9) for\nincrementing Bptr as well as the value of n (register %rdi) to check the loop\nThe need for two values does not show up in the C code, due to the scaling\narray.\nIt can

4-byte values of type int, a two-element\narray of type int, and an 8-byte integer pointer, giving a total of 24 bytes:\nObserve that array a is embedded within the structure.\nTo access the \ufb01elds of a structure, the compiler generates code that adds the\nappropriate offset to the address of the structure.\nThe struct data type constructor is the closest thing C provides to the objects of C++ and Java.\nWe can declare a variable r of type struct rect and set its \ufb01eld values as follows:\nwhere the expression r.llx selects \ufb01eld llx of structure r.\nIt is common to pass pointers to structures from one place to another rather than copying them.\nFor example, the following function computes the area of a rectangle, where a pointer to the rectangle\nThe expression (*rp).width dereferences the pointer and selects the width \ufb01eld of the resulting\nof type struct rec * is in register %rdi.\nThen the following code copies element\nr->i to element r->j:\nSince the offset of \ufb01eld i is 0, the address of this \ufb01eld is simply the value of r.\nstore into \ufb01eld j, the code adds offset 4 to the address of r.\nTo generate a pointer to an object within a structure, we can simply add the\n\ufb01eld\u2019s offset to the structure address.\nFor example, we can generate the pointer\nFor pointer r in register %rdi and long\ninteger variable i in register %rsi, we can generate the pointer value &(r->a[i])\nRegisters: r in %rdi, i %rsi\nAs a \ufb01nal example, the following code implements the statement\nAs these examples show, the selection of the

a miss, the cache at level k fetches the block\ncontaining d from the cache at level k + 1, possibly overwriting an existing block\nif the level k cache is already full.\nThe decision about which block to replace is governed by the cache\u2019s replacement\nAfter the cache at level k has fetched the block from level k + 1, the program\nfrom block 12 in the level k cache would result in a cache miss because block 12 is\nnot currently stored in the level k cache.\nKinds of Cache Misses\nthe cache at level k is empty, then any access of any data object will miss.\nempty cache is sometimes referred to as a cold cache, and misses of this kind are\nWhenever there is a miss, the cache at level k must implement some placement\nFor caches high in the memory hierarchy (close to\nNotice that

block\nDirect-Mapped Caches\nA cache with exactly one line per set (E = 1) is known as a direct-mapped\ncache (see Figure 6.27).\nhow caches work.\nSuppose we have a system with a CPU, a register \ufb01le, an L1 cache, and a main\nit requests the word from the L1 cache.\nOtherwise, we have a cache miss, and the CPU must wait while the L1\ncache requests a copy of the block containing w from the main memory.\nthe requested block \ufb01nally arrives from memory, the L1 cache stores the block in\none of its cache lines, extracts word w from the stored block, and returns it to the\nmapped cache.\nCache block\nCache block\nCache block\nmapped cache.\ncache block, w0 denotes\ncache line must \ncache hit, and\nSet Selection in Direct-Mapped Caches\nIn this step, the cache extracts the s

The server sends a response to the client and then waits for the next request.\nFor example, a Web server sends the \ufb01le back to a client.\nA client-server transaction.\nThe client-server model is the same, regardless\nof the mapping of clients and servers to hosts.\nClients and servers often run on separate hosts and communicate using the hard-\nof a network host.\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHowever, if host A\nsends a frame to host C on a different segment, then bridge X will copy the frame\nconnected to host C\u2019s segment.\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nEach router has an adapter (port) for each network that it is connected\nample, Figure 11.6 shows an example internet with a pair of LANs and WANs\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nHost\nEach host is\nways of assigning addresses to hosts.\ndifferences by de\ufb01ning a uniform format for host addresses.\nEach host\nis then assigned at least one of these internet addresses that uniquely\nFigure 11.7 shows an example of how hosts and routers use the internet\nprotocol to transfer data across incompatible LANs. The example internet consists\nA client running on host A, which is attached\nto LAN1, sends a sequence of data bytes to a server running on host B, which is\n1. The client on host A invokes a system call that copies the data from the client\u2019s\n2.

The sockets functions are typically implemented\nmechanism that can send packets, known as datagrams, from one Internet host to\nany other host.\n. The set of hosts is mapped to a set of 32-bit IP addresses.\nThe original Internet protocol, with its 32-bit addresses, is known as Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4).\nProtocol Version 6 (IPv6), that uses 128-bit addresses and that was intended as the successor to IPv4.\n. The set of IP addresses is mapped to a set of identi\ufb01ers called Internet domain\n. A process on one Internet host can communicate with a process on any other\nInternet host over a connection.\nIP Addresses\nAn IP address is an unsigned 32-bit integer.\nNetwork programs store IP addresses\nin the IP address structure shown in Figure 11.9.\nBecause Internet hosts can have different host byte orders, TCP/IP de\ufb01nes a\nas an IP address, that is carried across the network in a packet header.\nAddresses in\nIP address structures are always stored in (big-endian) network byte order, even\nconverting between network and host byte order.\n/* IP address structure */\ns_addr;
