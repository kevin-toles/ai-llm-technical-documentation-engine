This library supports an array of application-\nlevel programming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting. In\naddition, Python can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast\ncollection of third-party software. As covered ahead, Python’s third-party\ndomain offers tools for website construction, numeric programming, AI, and\nmuch more. The NumPy extension, for instance, has elevated Python to a\ncore tool in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and Django\n```\n[^3]\n**Annotation:** This excerpt demonstrates 'array' as it appears in the primary text.

Since the most common\nis, well, most common, let’s see how this works first.\nBytecode compilation\nInternally, and almost completely hidden from you, when you execute a program\nPython first compiles your source code (the statements in your text file) into a\nformat known as bytecode.

As you’ll find in this\nbook, its class model supports advanced notions such as polymorphism, operator\noverloading, and multiple inheritance; yet, in the context of Python’s simple\nsyntax and typing, OOP is remarkably easy to apply. In fact, if you don’t\nunderstand these terms, you’ll find they are much easier to learn with Python\nthan with just about any other OOP language available.\nOf equal significance, OOP is an option in Python; you can go far without\nhaving to become an object guru all at once. Much like C++, Python supports\n```\n[^6]\n**Annotation:** This excerpt demonstrates 'class' as it appears in the primary text.

As a slogan at an early Python conference\nattested, the net result is that Python seems to fit your brain—that is, features of\nthe language interact in consistent and limited ways and follow naturally from a\nsmall set of core concepts. This makes the language easier to learn, understand,\n```\n[^7]\n**Annotation:** This excerpt demonstrates 'close' as it appears in the primary text.

Once you learn the language itself,\nPython’s library tools are where much of the application-level action occurs.\n```\n[^9]\n**Annotation:** This excerpt demonstrates 'collections' as it appears in the primary text.

Though relatively rare today, you\nmay still occasionally need to get “closer to the iron” for some tasks by using\nlanguages that are more directly mapped to the underlying hardware.\nWe’ll talk about implementation concepts in Chapter 2, but in short, the most-\nused versions of Python today compile (i.e., translate) source code statements to\nan intermediate format known as bytecode and then interpret the bytecode.\n```\n[^10]\n**Annotation:** This excerpt demonstrates 'compiled' as it appears in the primary text.

This library supports an array of application-\nlevel programming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting. In\naddition, Python can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast\ncollection of third-party software. As covered ahead, Python’s third-party\ndomain offers tools for website construction, numeric programming, AI, and\nmuch more.

As you’ll find in this\nbook, its class model supports advanced notions such as polymorphism, operator\noverloading, and multiple inheritance; yet, in the context of Python’s simple\nsyntax and typing, OOP is remarkably easy to apply. In fact, if you don’t\nunderstand these terms, you’ll find they are much easier to learn with Python\nthan with just about any other OOP language available.\nOf equal significance, OOP is an option in Python; you can go far without\nhaving to become an object guru all at once.

When a name is available\nto a class in both a metaclass and a superclass, the superclass version is used.\nMetaclass declarations are also inherited by subclasses\n```\n[^771]\n**Annotation:** This excerpt demonstrates 'as' as it appears in the primary text.
