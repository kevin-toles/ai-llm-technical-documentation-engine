Rather, the goal is to present the core Python language, and the most essential parts of
the Python library in a manner that’s accurate and concise.This book assumes that the
reader has prior programming experience with Python or another language such as C
or Java. In addition, a general familiarity with systems programming topics (for example,
basic operating system concepts and network programming) may be useful in under-
standing certain parts of the library reference.
Python is freely available for download at http://www.python.org.Versions are avail-

Writing complex test cases commonly results in statements that involve an annoyingly
long line of code. To improve readability, you can continue any statement to the next line

tion. Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 are being released almost simultaneously.Yet, Python 3
is a release that breaks backwards compatibility with prior Python versions.As an author
and programmer, I’m faced with a dilemma: do I simply jump forward to Python 3.0 or
do I build upon the Python 2.x releases that are more familiar to most programmers?
Years ago, as a C programmer I used to treat certain books as the ultimate authority
on what programming language features should be used. For example, if you were using
something that wasn’t documented in the K&R book, it probably wasn’t going to be
portable and should be approached with caution.This approach served me very well as

you wish.

## Chapter 3: Types and Objects

*Source: Python Essential Reference, 4th Edition, pages 39–68*

### Chapter Summary
Examines Python's type system and object model in detail, covering built-in types (integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets), mutability, object identity, and memory management including garbage collection. [^39]

#### **Utf-8** *(p.54)*

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Essential Ref 4th, p.54, lines 18–25)*:
```
String literals should not be defined using a sequence of raw bytes that correspond to
a data encoding such as UTF-8 or UTF-16. For example, directly writing a raw UTF-8
encoded string such as 'Jalape\xc3\xb1o' simply produces a nine-character string
U+004A, U+0061, U+006C, U+0061, U+0070, U+0065, U+00C3, U+00B1,
U+006F, which is probably not what you intended.This is because in UTF-8, the multi-
byte sequence \xc3\xb1 is supposed to represent the single character U+00F1, not the
two characters U+00C3 and U+00B1.To specify an encoded byte string as a literal, pre-
fix the first quote with a "b" as in b"Jalape\xc3\xb1o".When defined, this literally

```
The s.translate() method is used to perform advanced character substitutions
such as quickly stripping all control characters out of a string.As an argument, it accepts
a translation table containing a one-to-one mapping of characters in the original string
to characters in the result. For 8-bit strings, the translation table is a 256-character
string. For Unicode, the translation table can be any sequence object s where s[n]
returns an integer character code or Unicode character corresponding to the Unicode
character with integer value n.
The s.encode() and s.decode() methods are used to transform string data to and

The import statement creates a new namespace and executes all the statements in the
associated .py file within that namespace.To access the contents of the namespace after
import, simply use the name of the module as a prefix, as in div.divide() in the pre-

If you want to import a module using a different name, supply the import statement
with an optional as qualifier, as follows:
import div as foo
a,b = foo.divide(2305,29)

As your programs grow in size, you will want to break them into multiple files for easi-

as a module that can be imported into other programs and scripts.To create a module,
put the relevant statements and definitions into a file that has the same name as the
module. (Note that the file must have a .py suffix.) Here’s an example:

When you use an expression to determine a true or false value, True, any nonzero
number, nonempty string, list, tuple, or dictionary is taken to be true. False; zero; None;
and empty lists, tuples, and dictionaries evaluate as false. Boolean expressions are evaluat-
ed from left to right and consume the right operand only if it’s needed to determine
the final value. For example, a and b evaluates b only if a is true.This is sometimes
known as “short-circuit” evaluation.

**Verbatim Educational Excerpt** *(Python Essential Ref 4th, p.101, lines 13–20)*:

The Function Call () Operator
The f(args) operator is used to make a function call on f. Each argument to a func-
tion is an expression. Prior to calling the function, all of the argument expressions are
fully evaluated from left to right.This is sometimes known as applicative order evaluation.
It is possible to partially evaluate function arguments using the partial() function
in the functools module. For example:
def foo(x,y,z):

When an exception occurs, the interpreter stops executing statements in the try block
and looks for an except clause that matches the exception that has occurred. If one is
found, control is passed to the first statement in the except clause.After the except
clause is executed, control continues with the first statement that appears after the 
try-except block. Otherwise, the exception is propagated up to the block of code in
which the try statement appeared.This code may itself be enclosed in a try-except
that can handle the exception. If an exception works its way up to the top level of a
program without being caught, the interpreter aborts with an error message. If desired,

The __new__() method of a class is something that is rarely defined by user code. If it
is defined, it is typically written with the prototype __new__(cls, *args,
**kwargs) where args and kwargs are the same arguments that will be passed to
__init__(). __new__() is always a class method that receives the class object as the
first parameter.Although __new__() creates an instance, it does not automatically call
__init__().
If you see __new__() defined in a class, it usually means the class is doing one of

Class variables such as num_accounts are values that are shared among all instances
of a class (that is, they’re not individually assigned to each instance). In this case, it’s a
variable that’s keeping track of how many Account instances are in existence.

versal newline mode and is set to None, '', '\n', '\r', or '\r\n'. If set to None, any
line ending of the form '\n', '\r', or '\r\n' is translated into '\n'. If set to '' (the
empty string), any of these line endings are recognized as newlines, but left untranslated

minate lines. closefd controls whether the underlying file descriptor is actually closed
when the close() method is invoked. By default, this is set to True.

than directly performing these operations on a dictionary. If all you are doing is build-

Some library modules provide new types that outperform the built-ins at certain tasks.
For instance, the collection.deque type provides similar functionality to a list but has
been highly optimized for the insertion of new items at both ends.A list, in contrast, is
only efficient when appending items at the end. If you insert items at the front, all of
the other elements need to be shifted in order to make room.The time required to do
this grows as the list gets larger and larger. Just to give you an idea of the difference,

Python threads are actually rather restricted.Although minimally thread-safe, the Python
interpreter uses an internal global interpreter lock (the GIL) that only allows a single
Python thread to execute at any given moment.This restricts Python programs to run
on a single processor regardless of how many CPU cores might be available on the sys-
tem.Although the GIL is often a heated source of debate in the Python community, it
is unlikely to be removed at any time in the foreseeable future.
The presence of the GIL has a direct impact on how many Python programmers
