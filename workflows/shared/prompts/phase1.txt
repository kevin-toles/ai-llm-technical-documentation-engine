You are conducting a comprehensive gap analysis for Learning Python Ed.6 cross-references.

CHAPTER CONTEXT:
- Chapter {chapter_num}: {chapter_title}
- Key Concepts: {concepts}

CHAPTER EXCERPT:

PYTHON KEYWORD MATCHING RESULTS:
{concept_mapping}

COMPANION BOOK METADATA ({total_books} books, {total_pages} pages):
{books_metadata}

TASK: Analyze the metadata and identify what specific content you need to perform a thorough scholarly cross-text analysis.

RESPOND IN JSON FORMAT:
{{
  "validation_summary": "Which Python matches look promising vs. superficial?",
  "gap_analysis": "What concepts/areas might be missing from Python matching?",
  "content_requests": [
    {{
      "book_name": "<<COPY EXACT file_name HERE>>",
      "pages": [page numbers],
      "rationale": "why needed",
      "priority": 1-5
    }}
  ],
  "analysis_strategy": "planned approach"
}}

CRITICAL: For book_name, copy the EXACT file_name value from metadata. Examples:
✅ CORRECT: "Fluent Python 2nd" (matches file_name in metadata)
✅ CORRECT: "Python Distilled" (matches file_name in metadata)  
✅ CORRECT: "Architecture Patterns with Python" (matches file_name)
❌ WRONG: "Fluent Python, 2nd Edition" (don't add commas or Edition)
❌ WRONG: "Python Distilled Content" (don't add Content)

Look at the file_name field in the metadata above and copy it character-for-character.

GUIDELINES FOR ANALYZING PYTHON KEYWORD MATCHING RESULTS:
1. EVALUATE MATCHES: Review the concept_mapping data showing which books/pages match each concept
   - High relevance (>0.7): Strong indicator of substantive coverage
   - Medium relevance (0.4-0.7): May be worth investigating
   - Low relevance (<0.4): Likely superficial mentions

2. VALIDATE PROMISING MATCHES: Request pages from high-relevance matches to verify they provide:
   - Technical depth beyond simple keyword mentions
   - Different perspectives or advanced treatment
   - Architectural or implementation context

3. IDENTIFY GAPS: Look for concepts that may need coverage beyond keyword matching:
   - Abstract concepts that may appear under different terminology
   - Architectural patterns that connect to the chapter's concepts
   - Implementation techniques not directly named in the chapter

4. APPLY BOOK TAXONOMY (evaluate ALL 15 books comprehensively):
   
   ARCHITECTURE SPINE BOOKS (foundational patterns):
   - Architecture Patterns with Python: DDD/Event-Driven foundation, cascades to implementation
   - Building Microservices: Conceptual rationale, organizational patterns
   - Microservice Architecture: Academic theory, formal design patterns
   - Python Architecture Patterns: Pattern catalog, architectural crosswalks
   
   IMPLEMENTATION LAYER BOOKS (practical application):
   - Python Microservices Development: Docker, async, deployment scaffolding
   - Building Python Microservices with FastAPI: Modern async, dependency injection
   - Microservice APIs Using Python Flask FastAPI: API governance, versioning
   - Microservices Up and Running: Operational lifecycle, observability
   
   ENGINEERING PRACTICES BOOKS (language and idioms):
   - Python Essential Reference 4th: Language syntax and semantics foundation
   - Fluent Python 2nd: Advanced Pythonic patterns, protocols, metaclasses
   - Python Distilled: Concise best practices and core concepts
   - Python Cookbook 3rd: Recipe-based practical solutions
   - Python Data Analysis 3rd: Data structures and analysis patterns
   - Learning Python Ed6: (Primary text - do not self-reference)

5. USE CASCADING LOGIC: When a concept triggers matches in one tier, check related tiers:
   - Engineering concept (e.g., "decorator") → Check Architecture books for decorator pattern
   - Architecture pattern → Check Implementation books for practical applications
   - Implementation technique → Check Engineering books for language fundamentals

6. REQUEST STRATEGICALLY:
   - Include ALL books with relevance > 0.3 (typically 8-15 books for comprehensive analysis)
   - Organize requests by tier (Architecture → Implementation → Engineering)
   - Request 3-8 pages per book focusing on highest-relevance matches
   - Set priority 5 for foundational concepts, 3-4 for supporting context, 1-2 for peripheral references

7. CROSS-TIER VALIDATION:
   - If Engineering Practice book shows high relevance, check if Architecture books provide patterns
   - If Architecture book matches, verify Implementation books show practical usage
   - Build many-to-many mapping across all applicable books
